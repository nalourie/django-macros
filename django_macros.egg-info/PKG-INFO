Description: django-macros
        =============
        
        Macros accepting positional and keyword arguments, and repeated block
        tags in the django template system. Sometimes include tags just don't
        get the job done. Either you have repeated code that you want to keep
        all in the same single template, or your code needs to dynamically
        generate and sub in certain values, in a way that the include syntax
        inhibits. Whatever the case, if you're finding that the built in include
        tag just isn't working for your use case, then perhaps django-macros is
        for you.

        Installation:
        =============
        
        from the command line:
        
        ::
        
            pip install django-macros
        
        Within settings.py, add 'macros' to INSTALLED\_APPS:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'macros',
                ...
            )
        
        Useage:
        =======
        
        django-macros contains two template tag libraries, one for creating
        macros within templates, and one for repeating block tags.
        
        Macros Useage
        -------------
        
        Explained Useage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        At the beginning of your file include:
        
        ::
        
            {% load macros %}
        
        When you have a section of your template you want to repeat, but don't
        want to have inherited or any other block tag-like functionality, define
        a macro as follows:
        
        ::
        
            {% macro some_macro_name arg1 arg2 kwarg="default" %}
                {{ arg1 }} was the first argument.
                {{ arg2 }} was the second argument.
        
                {% if kwarg %}This is a {{ kwarg }}. {% endif %}
            {% endmacro %}
        
        Then when you want to use the macro, simply do:
        
        ::
        
            {% use_macro some_macro_name "foo" "bar" kwarg="nondefault value" %}
        
        which renders to:
        
        ::
        
            foo was the first argument.
            bar was the second argument.
            This is a nondefault value.
        
        Alternatively, you can save your macros in a separate file, e.g.
        "mymacros.html" and load it into the template with the tag
        ``{% loadmacros "mymacros.html" %}`` then use them with the
        ``{% use_macro ... %}`` tag.
        
        All macros, including loaded ones, are local to the template file they
        are loaded into/defined in, and are not inherited through
        ``{% extends ... %}`` tags.
        
        A more in-depth useage example:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Macro:
        ^^^^^^
        
        You can also input template variables into the macros, but filters are
        not supported. That is, you cannot use filters in the arguments.
        
        If the context where \`{'foo': 'foobar'}
        
        ::
        
            {% macro test2args1kwarg arg1 arg2 baz="Default baz" %}
                {% firstof arg1 "default arg1" %}
                {% if arg2 %}{{ arg2 }}{% else %}default arg2{% endif %}
                {{ baz }}
            {% endmacro %}
                        
        
            {% use_macro test2args1kwarg "foo" "bar" baz="KW" %}
            <br>
            {% use_macro test2args1kwarg num_pages "bar" %}
            <br>
            {% use_macro test2args1kwarg %}
        
        renders as:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            foo bar KW
            77 bar Default baz
            default arg1 default arg2 Default baz
        
        Extended Syntax
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Sometimes you might want to include data that is rendered by the
        template engine, or longer data containing a lot of html in a macro. For
        this, the syntax of plugging arguments directly into the tag doesn't
        really work, so instead of
        ``{% use_macro some_macro_name "arg" kwarg_name="value" %}``, use the
        syntax below:
        
        ::
        
            {% macro_block some_macro_name %}
                {% macro_arg %}
                    arg
                {% endmacro_arg %}
                
                {% macro_kwarg kwname %}
                    value
                {% endmacro_kwarg %}
            {% endmacro_block %}
        
        Note that with this syntax you no longer have to quote
        strings/arguments. If you have a mix of longer and shorter arguments,
        you can also use both syntaxes simultaneously:
        
        ::
        
            {% macro_block some_macro_name "arg1" kwname1="value1" %}
                {% macro_arg %}
                    arg2
                {% endmacro_arg %}
                
                {% macro_kwarg kwname2 %}
                    value2
                {% endmacro_kwarg %}
            {% endmacro_block %}
        
        Repeated Blocks Useage:
        -----------------------
        
        At the beginning of your file include:
        
        ::
        
            {% load repeatedblocks %}
        
        When you have a block that you want to repeat, instead of using a block
        tag, use a repeated block:
        
        ::
        
            {% repeated_block some_block name %}
                ...
                ...
                ...
            {% endblock %}
        
        Later, when you want to repeat that block again, simply include the
        repeat tag:
        
        ::
        
            {% repeat some_block name %}
        
        Thus, the following template:
        
        ::
        
            {% repeated_block title %}Repeated Block Tags{% endblock %}
        
            {% repeat title %}
        
        Renders to:
        
        ::
        
            Repeated Block Tags
        
            Repeated Block Tags
        
        Make sure that the ``{% repeat ... %}`` tag comes **after** the
        ``{% repeated_block ... %} ... {% endblock %}`` tag.
        
        They are fully inheritable, repeat inherited content and should work
        exactly as you'd expect a block tag to work.
        
        Bonus Content!
        ==============
        
        Design Explanation for repeatedblocks.py:
        -----------------------------------------
        
        Using a "repeated\_block" followed by "repeat" tag structure, as opposed
        to just repeating normal block tags, forces developers to be more
        explicit about what is repeated. Thus, it guards against the potential
        to remove block tags later in development, not realize they are
        repeated, and create an error later. Hence, we've chosen this design
        since it's more advantageous/pythonic in being explicit as well as dry.

        The macros tags are based on snippet originally by `Michal
        Ludvig <http://www.logix.cz/michal>`__, michal@logix.cz, later modified
        for args and kwargs by `Skylar Saveland <http://skyl.org>`__.
        
        Code was updated for django 1.6, modified, and packaged by Nicholas
        Lourie, while working for `kozbox, llc <http://kozbox.com>`__. Nick also
        added the extended syntax to the macros.
